# Optimistic ToDos - A React Experiment with Optimistic Updates

A React-based todo application that explores the challenges and solutions of implementing optimistic updates in real-world scenarios. This project demonstrates how to handle out-of-order server responses while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## The Challenge

This project tackles a common real-world problem: **optimistic updates with unreliable network responses**. The application allows users to:

- Reorder todos via drag and drop
- Toggle todo completion status
- Experience immediate UI feedback while handling slow, out-of-order server responses

The core challenge is maintaining a consistent user experience when server responses arrive in a different order than requests were sent, which is a realistic scenario in production environments.

## Key Features

- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for all user actions
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Smooth reordering with visual feedback
- **Out-of-Order Response Handling**: Robust handling of server responses that arrive in unexpected order
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching with TanStack Query
- **Modern React**: Built with React 19 and latest patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Optimistic Update Strategy

The application implements a sophisticated optimistic update system that:

1. **Immediately updates the UI** when users perform actions
2. **Queues server requests** and tracks their order
3. **Handles out-of-order responses** by maintaining request metadata
4. **Reconciles conflicts** when server state differs from optimistic state

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Styling**: CSS with modern layout techniques
- **Backend**: Hono server with simulated network delays

## API Endpoints

The application communicates with a local server that simulates real-world network conditions:

- `GET /todos` - Fetch todos with their current order
- `PUT /todos-order` - Update todo ordering
- `PUT /todos/:id` - Toggle todo completion status

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will start both the backend server (port 8123) and the frontend development server.

## Learning Goals

This project explores several important concepts in modern web development:

- **Optimistic UI patterns** and their trade-offs
- **Race condition handling** in concurrent operations
- **Error boundaries** and graceful degradation
- **TypeScript** best practices for complex state management
- **React Query** patterns for real-time data synchronization
